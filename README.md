# WiFinder
###Finding your nearby and free WiFi providers 

WiFinder is a RESTful service that finds your nearby WiFi Hotspots. You can see it's live version on <a href="https://wifinder-v1-1.herokuapp.com/">my Heroku.</a>

I have devoped this as part of the main project of the boook Getting MEAN: MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.js. Also, I have fixed soome of the bugs that author made.

WiFinder is already functional but still under development. I'll add more features to it, soon.
